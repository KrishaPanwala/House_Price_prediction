🏠 House Price Prediction
A machine learning project to predict house prices using various regression models like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XGBoost. This project explores feature engineering, data visualization, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
 
Features & Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Visualized continuous, discrete, and categorical variables.
-Identified feature types: numerical, year-related, discrete, continuous, and categorical.

2. Data Preprocessing
-Handled categorical variables using target encoding.
-Scaled continuous features using StandardScaler.
-Removed highly correlated features (correlation > 0.8).

3. Modeling
-Random Forest Regressor
-Linear Regression
-XGBoost Regressor

4. Evaluation Metrics
-R² Score
-Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
